#MERN Website
In this project, I have used NodeJS for the backend server and designed the APIs. 
For the database, I have used mongoDB.
For frontend, i have used ReactJS to render my website components.
It uses an Express server.

#To Run
1. Clone the repo using the git clone command.
2. Go to the folder and write npm start in the terminal.
3. The Backend server automatically starts, followed by the frontend React server.
