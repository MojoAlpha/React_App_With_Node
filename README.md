# MERN Website
In this project, I have used NodeJS for the backend server and designed the APIs. 
For the database, I have used mongoDB.
For frontend, i have used ReactJS to render my website components.
It uses an Express server.

# To Run
* Clone the repo using the git clone command.
* Go to the folder and write npm start in the terminal.
* The Backend server automatically starts, followed by the frontend React server.
